    <p>a simple web-scraping python bot for the hourly top-rated posts on r/showerthoughts.</p>
    <p>the bot does not use the reddit api; rather, it parses the site's html directly. it does, however, use
    mastodon's api, which is relatively new and untrodden territory in comparison.
    <p>some backstory: i had created (and quickly abandoned) a mastodon account after the tumblr policy change
    announcement, and coded this bot shortly after that. i realized that the site's novelty meant that many
    bot niches from tumblr had yet to be filled, so that even one as relatively simple as this was fair game to recreate.</p>
    <p>it felt like an arms race, experimenting with the foreign api and testing protocols before someone else
    could do the same thing as me. this project pushed me into a lot of unfamiliar territory, especially when it
    came to finding a way of automating the script, but it all paid off with a functional and prolific bot account.</p>
    <p>despite my success, no one still uses mastodon. oh well.</p>
